edit user page has an error when you submit it.
# Non logged in user can apply for divorce
# Non logged in user can have funeral
# Non logged in user trying to POST to edit_user causes an error
# When you delete the current password input box in edit_user and then submit the form it causes an error
you can submit invalid IDs (-1) into the funeral form
# edit_user does not check if a username is already taken #not actually an error
in the table creation function new_id is set loads of times but not used
# allsessions is printed out
no validataion for wedding_form or divorce_form (or most of the other form) values at all
healthcare_id is not checked against any foreign keys i think
no foreign key relationships in tables
Lack of feedback for some form inputs means we will get 1 for presentation
# staff and admin registration no longer visible from register page? but user can still use form to register as admin
No functions for staff that I can see
Admin cannot edit user details
Admin cannot clear database from website
admin cannot load the sql_log into the website, has to look at file.
admin changes validataion does not work.
# I think anyone can access admin
as far as I can tell it doesn't check what the role of user is when doing stuff.
