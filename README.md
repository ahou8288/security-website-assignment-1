# IT security website #

This website was written for the IT security course.

For this website I focused on writing the sql backend and the security.py file which handles most of the session management.

Modules like django or other heavier web frameworks were avoided (not allowed for the assignment), and things like session management were implemented from scratch so that we could learn these concepts.
